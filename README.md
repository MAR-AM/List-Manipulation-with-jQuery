# List-Manipulation-with-jQuery
This HTML document showcases how to dynamically manipulate a list using jQuery. The page includes an input field for entering new list items, a button to add these items to the list, and an instruction paragraph.
When the "Ajouter" button is clicked, the new item is appended to the list if the input field is not empty. Additionally, users can remove any item from the list by double-clicking on it. The jQuery script handles these interactions, ensuring smooth user experience. Basic CSS styles the input, button, and list items for a clean and user-friendly interface.
